# Brickify

Brickify is a tool to create custom LEGO frames using dot-type bricks from your own photos. This UI helps you experiment with different photos and determine the colors and quantities of bricks needed.

## Features

- Upload and crop images
- Resize images to focus on the most relevant areas
- Display the output
- Generate an inventory of required colors

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://danuw.github.io/brickify/](https://danuw.github.io/brickify/)
2. Upload an image, crop it, resize it, and view the output along with the color inventory.

## Notes

- LEGO dot-type bricks are typically sold in packs of 1000, either in specific colors or mixed. Keep this in mind when selecting your palette.

We welcome contributions! Here are some planned improvements:

- [x] Publish to GitHub Pages for easy access
- [ ] Selectable palettes from predefined sets
- [ ] More palette options
- [ ] Custom palettes
- [ ] Lock aspect ratio for final output
- [ ] Use 16x16 plates format for preset sizes and ratios
